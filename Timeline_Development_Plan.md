# Development Timeline and Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development phases and timeline for the Next.js 14 S3 Audio Management App. The project will be completed in a maximum of 2 months, focusing on incremental development and feature deployment.

---

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Week 1–2
**Goal:** Set up the project foundation and implement authentication.

- Initialize the project with Next.js 14 and MongoDB integration.
- Implement user authentication (login, signup, and password protection).
- Create a responsive UI template and integrate the light/dark mode toggle.
- Develop a basic settings page for user profile management.

### Phase 2: Week 3–4
**Goal:** S3 file management and audio playback.

- Integrate AWS SDK for listing and retrieving S3 bucket files.
- Implement filtering functionality for:
  - Client Name (mapped from DNIS in MongoDB).
  - Agent Name (extracted from file names).
  - Date range (1–31 days in a month).
- Build an audio player component with secure playback.
- Restrict unauthorized access (disable download, right-click, etc.).

### Phase 3: Week 5–6
**Goal:** Sharing functionality and advanced filtering.

- Create functionality for generating shareable, password-protected links.
- Develop the secure page for accessing shared files with playback and metadata.
- Extend filtering capabilities to dynamically include additional parameters if needed.

### Phase 4: Week 7–8
**Goal:** Finalize, test, and deploy.

- Add MongoDB CRUD operations for client name/DNIS mappings.
- Conduct extensive testing for:
  - User authentication and permissions.
  - S3 file management and playback.
  - Shareable links and security.
- Set up production deployment using Vercel or AWS.
- Prepare documentation and deployment guides.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Authentication
- Define project structure using Next.js 14 app folder routing.
- Set up MongoDB collections (`users`, `files`, `shared_links`).
- Build reusable UI components for forms, modals, and navigation.

### Phase 2: File Management
- Use Python script logic for metadata extraction and filtering.
- Create API endpoints for frontend integration.
- Develop a secure audio player component.

### Phase 3: Sharing and Security
- Implement shareable link generation with expiration and password protection.
- Secure frontend pages for accessing shared files.

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- Perform end-to-end testing.
- Optimize the app for performance and scalability.
- Deploy to a production environment (e.g., Vercel, AWS).
